    description: "The Porsche 718 nameplate was revived in 2016 for the fourth generation of the Boxster and Cayman models, paying homage to the successful Porsche 718 race car from the late 1950s and early 1960s. This generation marked a significant powertrain shift, replacing the naturally aspirated flat-six engines with turbocharged flat-four engines. The base models received a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 300 horsepower, while the S variants featured a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four with 350 horsepower. The GTS models, introduced in 2017, initially used an uprated version of the 2.5-liter turbo-four with 365 horsepower before reverting to a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six with 394 horsepower in 2020. The track-focused Cayman GT4 and Boxster Spyder models retained naturally aspirated flat-six engines. Although the switch to four-cylinder engines was controversial among purists, the 718 generation delivered improved torque, better fuel economy, and enhanced performance figures. The chassis was refined with technology derived from the 911, including retuned suspension, upgraded brakes, and more responsive steering. The interior was modernized with Porsche's latest PCM infotainment system, while the exterior design was updated with more aggressive styling, revised lighting, and refreshed bumpers. Despite initially facing criticism for its engine note compared to the previous flat-six, the 718 generation has earned respect for its exceptional handling dynamics, precise steering, and impressive performance capabilities."
